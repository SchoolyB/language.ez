# EZ Documentation

Welcome to the EZ documentation. EZ is a simple programming language designed to teach real programming fundamentals without unnecessary complexity.

## Quick Start

1. [Download EZ](/language.ez/downloads) for your platform
2. [Install EZ](/language.ez/getting-started) on your system
3. Create a file called `hello.ez`:

```ez
import @std

do main() {
    std.println("Hello, EZ!")
}
```

> **Note:** Every EZ program must have a `main()` function — this is where your program starts running.

Save your file.

4. Use the following command to run your program:

```bash
ez hello.ez
```

Output:

```
Hello, EZ!
```
