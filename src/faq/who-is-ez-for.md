question: "Who is EZ for?"
order: 1
---

Everyone. But especially you if you're just starting out.

## The Primary Audience

### Beginners

EZ was built with you in mind first. If you've never written code before, EZ is designed to be your first language. The syntax reads like English, error messages explain what went wrong, and there's no hidden complexity waiting to trip you up.

You don't need:
- A computer science degree
- Prior programming experience
- Knowledge of "design patterns"
- Understanding of memory management

You just need curiosity and willingness to learn.

### Hobbyists

Want to automate something? Build a small tool? Tinker with code on weekends? EZ is perfect for projects where you want to get things done without fighting your tools.

### Experienced Developers

If you're tired of complexity, EZ might be refreshing. No frameworks to configure. No dependency trees to manage. No implicit behavior to debug. Just explicit, predictable code.

Experienced developers can unlock EZ's full power. The high skill ceiling means there's depth here if you want it.

### Educators and Students

Teaching programming? EZ's clarity makes concepts visible. Students can focus on learning to think like a programmer instead of memorizing syntax quirks.

## What Can You Build With EZ?

### Right Now

- **Scripts** — Automate tasks, process files, transform data
- **CLI tools** — Build command-line utilities
- **Small to medium projects** — Applications that don't need enterprise scale
- **Learning projects** — The best way to learn is by building

### The Future

The goal is for EZ to grow into a language capable of:
- Systems programming
- Production applications
- Larger-scale software

This is the dream I am working toward.

## What Do You Need to Know Before Starting?

### Technical Requirements

- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Internet connection (to download EZ and read docs)

That's it.

### Language Requirements

EZ's syntax is designed to read like plain English. You don't need to be a native English speaker — if you can read this page, you can read EZ code.

The documentation was tested with non-native English speakers and they understood it. If you're proficient enough in English to navigate daily life, you're proficient enough to learn EZ.

### Prior Programming Experience

**Not required.**

EZ is designed to be approachable for people who have never written a line of code. If you DO have experience, great — you'll pick it up even faster.

## Who Might EZ NOT Be For?

### Right Now

If you need to build something that requires:
- High-performance computing (use Rust or C)
- Mobile apps (use Swift, Kotlin)
- Web frontends (use JavaScript)
- Machine learning (use Python)

...then EZ isn't the right tool today. EZ is focused on being great at what it does, not being mediocre at everything.

### Philosophically

If you:
- Love OOP and class hierarchies
- Want a massive ecosystem of packages
- Prefer implicit over explicit behavior
- Think complexity equals power

...you might not vibe with EZ's philosophy. And that's okay; use what works for you.

## The Bottom Line

EZ is for anyone who wants to learn programming or wants a simpler way to write code.

Beginner? Start here.
Expert? Try something different.
Curious? Give it a shot.
